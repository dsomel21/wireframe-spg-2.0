# wireframe-spg-2.0

This project tests some mockup designs for [SPG](https://spg.dev/) v2. Still a WIP.

The design is crafted by a friend, [Jonathon Collie](https://www.jonathancollie.com/]); a UX designer from Kitchener-Waterloo. 

## Tools

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* React [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) (Next.js edition)
* Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
